CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY:

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is often used in scenarios where a request needs to be processed by multiple handlers sequentially until it's handled appropriately or until it reaches the end of the chain. A real-life use case for the Chain of Responsibility pattern could be a customer support ticketing system.

Components Involved:
Handler Interface or Abstract Class:
Defines an interface for handling requests. It usually contains a method like handleRequest.

Concrete Handlers: 
Implement the Handler interface. Each concrete handler decides whether it can handle the request or should pass it to the next handler in the chain.

Client: 
Initiates requests to the chain of handlers. It doesn't need to know the chain's structure; it just sends requests to the first handler in the chain.

Key Concepts:
Handler Chain: 
Represents the sequence of handlers linked together. Each handler has a reference to the next handler in the chain.

Request:
 Represents the object being passed along the chain. It contains the information needed for processing but does not dictate how the request is handled.

Request Processing: 
The process by which a request is either handled by a handler in the chain or passed to the next handler.
